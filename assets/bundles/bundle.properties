family.hollow-frostscape-hunter.details = [#dde6f0]Hunters[] are often built with at least one of three traits in mind.\n\nSpeed, range or stealth.\n\nThis makes them [accent]ideal[] for "hunting" or harassing targets.\n\nSpecialized hunters can serve a secondary use, although less pronounced. Speedier hunters can be used to scout ahead, or to patrol territory. Particularly stealthy hunters can be used as ambush units, although not built for facing full armies or assaulting buildings behind the front lines. Overall though they are quite [accent]versatile[].\n\nDespite their abilities, they are generally [red]worse[] at dealing with [accent]organized defenses[] than [accent]small outposts or assault squads[].\n\nMost hunters are best used alone, and do not lend much support to army compositions, however certain hunters may provide boosts to allied units in an area around themselves, making them a slight bit more useful when in a group.

What does and doesn't belong in the specialist family is a puzzling question, due to their [accent]"niche"[] nature. \n\nThey are a wildcard of a family, and should be used to the best of their [accent]strengths[].
